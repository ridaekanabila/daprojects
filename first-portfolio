# My first data analytics portfolio

With huge interest in Data Analytics, I decided to join RevoU Mini Course Data Analytics Batch 30 May 2022 - 11 June 2022. In 10 days, I learned a lot of basics about Data Analytics. While I joined this mini course, I did some case studies that included as a optional assignment.

Today, I present one of case study that I did as my first Data Analytics Portfolio. With this portfolio as my first step in Data Analytics, I hope to learn more about Data Analytics.

Please feel free to comment and give an advice about my first portfolio, so I can learn to make better portfolio.

Thank you!
